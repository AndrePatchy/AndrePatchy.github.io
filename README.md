## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Autonomous (February 2023 - present)**
- I've developed 8 data science and machine learning projects with Python, SQL and PowerBI, following a CRISP-DM methodology. Each project can be found in detail bellow. 

**Data Analyst @ Universidade de Coimbra (July 2020 - November 2022)**
- I've analysed a entrepreneurship programme with 10 editions, +2500 participants and +150 partners. I've translated findings into actionable insights, which supported the preparation of the 11th edition of the programme, and the strengthening of partnerships.
- In collaboration, we developed a business idea with the aim of creating a startup in the IT sector.

**Assistant Analyst @ Frutibairrada (June 2019 - April 2021)**
- I worked with the company's purchasing and sales logistics analysis team. I improved the purchasing management pipeline, saving the company thousands of euros. 

## Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

#1 **Predictive Analysis of Customer Response (Supervised Learning)**
**Goals** of the project:
- Build a predictive model that can generate the maximum profit for the upcoming six months
direct marketing campaign of the company
- Predict customer behavior

**Solution:** EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Engineer, Model Selection, Model Optimization

**Results:** We applied Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression to predict the response of customers to a new marketing campaign. 
As you can see from the ROC Curve, where we plotted the TPR againist the FPR, among the models evaluated NN has the best performance. Hence, the choosen to make the predictions.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy. sklearn), Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, Git, PowerPoint, Notion, CRISP-DM Methodology

#2 **Curbing Employee Attrition (Supervised Learning)**
**Goals** of the project:
- Descriptive analysis: find correlations between the different variables, clustering analysis, build nice visualizations that may help to get better insights for the analysis, check featureâ€™s cardinality, and analyze possible highly correlated features that may be removed
- Predictive analysis: Build a classification model to predict attrition

**Solution:** EDA, Feature Selection, Data Engineering, Modelling, Clustering and Statistical Tests

**Results:** we identified 3 distinct groups of employees, which require different measures. Our model can correctly identify 69% of employees at risk of leaving the company.

#3 Customer Profiling 

**Goals** of the project:
- Segment customers of Spice Alley through clustering algorithms

**Solution:** Understanding & Exploring Data, Data Preparation and Modelling

**Results:** Our approach divides the data into 4 perspectives: Customer Value, Customer Behavior, Channel Preference and Demographics characterization. We also divided the customers into 3 groups: lurkers high vakye clients with a risk of churning and loyal clients.
