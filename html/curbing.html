        <div class="card curbing">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The HR team collected data from employees and we've been asked to predict the attrition of an employee, i.e. the probability of an employee with certain characteristics stay or quit his/her current job in the company. We've must build a model to use by this company's HR team warning them about employees that potentially will quit.</p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Analytics:</strong> Find correlations between the different variables, possibility of clustering analysis, build nice visualizations that may help to get better insights for the analysis, check featureâ€™s cardinality and analyze possible highly correlation features that may be removed and still achieve good results.</li>
                <p> </p>
                <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Build classification models to predict the Attrition probability and the final classification given by the model.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>We've identified 3 distinct groups of employees, which require a personalized approach. Our model can correctly identify 69% of employees at risk of leaving the company. The index we have followed is:</p>
